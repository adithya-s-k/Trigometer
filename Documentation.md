 Aim - To figure out a way to measure the angle
 \
 \
Tried to see is potentiometer and be used to figure out the angle but the reading were very inaccurate and inconsistent.
So decided to use the MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope sensor to calculate the angle.

Was successfully able to print the angle of each axis on the serial monitor.
